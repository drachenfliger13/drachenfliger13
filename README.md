## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github

as you can see, there is not much to explore...

But the world has sooooo much, meaning I am learning and not ready to publish my code **yet** , maybe another time.

My primarily used languages are C#, Python, Java 
looking foreword to learning Rust

Also other important things like pipelines and Documentation are Fields I am currently exploring.

I hope, that I soon can have an even more welcoming Page and can share a little more about me :3
