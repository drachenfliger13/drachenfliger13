## Hi there 👋

### Welcome to my Github

as you can see, there is not much to explore...

But the world has sooooo much, meaning I am learning and not ready to publish my code **yet** , maybe another time.

My primarily used languages are C#, Python, Java. 
I am looking foreword to learning Rust.

### About me

I am currently an apprentice for application development in a German company.

Please if you expect me to be active on here, I am sporadically doing something but could also be stuck in
a depressive episeode.
